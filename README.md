# marketing-page2

#### A page by Skyler Dowdy
Started 4/15/2019

I am using a base that I built myself in a [codepen](https://codepen.io/skyler-dowdy/pen/wZPWZo).

I am building it using:

* HTML
* LESS
* Java Script


You can see my changelog [HERE!](Changelog.md)

I will be explaining more of my project below as I move along.

#Use My Tools
##Build Week 1 Project

My part of the project was to build a simple one to two page "marketing site" telling what our project was about.

I built the landing page and the about page. They are both mobile responsive and include dropdowns for the menu bars once the page reaches a certian width.

The about page uses tabs to showcase each one of the developers that worked on the project.
